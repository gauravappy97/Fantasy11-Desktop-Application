# Fantasy11-Desktop-Application
<h3>View full presentation of this project : <a href="Fantasy Premier League - Gaurav.pdf">Fantasy11</a></h3>
<p>This training consisted of Principles of Object-oriented
Programming (OOP), Connecting to SQLite Database, Developing a GUI with PyQT and Application of Python in Various Disciplines modules. Based on the above technology stack, I built a desktop-based application named Fantasy11. </p>
<p>In this application :</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
           Users can create their team.
    </li>
    <li>
           They can save their team and use them after any time.
    </li>
    <li>
           They can view their team in the "Open Team" section.
    </li>
    <li>
           Finally, they can evaluate their team score based on the selection of matches.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here, I have followed some basic rules for calculating the score of matches, that I have added below..!</p>
